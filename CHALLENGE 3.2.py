#3.2 Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.cgpa = cgpa

def sort_students(student_list):
    sorted_students = sorted(student_list, key=lambda student: student.cgpa, reverse=True)
    return sorted_students

# Example usage:
student1 = Student("HARISH", "S123", 3.7)
student2 = Student("SUBASH", "S124", 3.9)
student3 = Student("ALMASS", "S125", 3.5)
student4 = Student("ABHITHA", "S126", 3.8)

students = [student1, student2, student3, student4]

sorted_students = sort_students(students)

# Print the sorted list of students by CGPA in descending order
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, CGPA: {student.cgpa}")
